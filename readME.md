# Inventory Management System - A University Project by Rocco and Pettric

Welcome to the Inventory Management System, a collaborative effort by Rocco and Pettric for our Program Design and Construction project. This comprehensive application is designed to empower you with efficient inventory management, leveraging text or CSV files as the data storage medium. Whether you're a future entrepreneur, a meticulous warehouse manager, or simply someone seeking order in your belongings, our system offers an intuitive command-line interface to simplify your inventory tasks.

## Features

- **Item Addition**: Seamlessly integrate new items into your inventory by providing essential details such as name, description, price, and quantity.
- **Item Removal**: Effortlessly remove unnecessary items from your inventory.
- **Quantity Adjustment**: Dynamically modify item quantities as they are procured, sold, or restocked.
- **Full Control**: Exercise complete control over your inventory. Add, remove, and modify items on the fly to accommodate your evolving needs.
- **Order Generation**: When you're ready to initiate an order, our system assembles your current inventory into an organized order. This order includes pertinent information about selected items, their quantities, and the total cost.
- **Receipt Issuance**: Alongside the order, our system generates a detailed receipt. This receipt provides a comprehensive breakdown of each item, its respective quantity, individual cost, and the grand total of the order.
- **Inventory Reset**: Following a successful order creation, the system performs an automatic inventory reset, ensuring a clean slate for future additions.
- **User Authentication**: The system allows users to sign up and log in with unique credentials. Each user has a personalized set of orders, ensuring privacy and individualized access to their data.
